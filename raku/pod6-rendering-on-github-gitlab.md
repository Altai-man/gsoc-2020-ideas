# Pod6 rendering on GitHub/GitLab

Description
-----------

We still don't have Pod6 rendering on GitHub or GitLab. We know what needs to
be done, but time is a precious resource. I think this is a project a student
can perform, and can teach them a lot about working with multiple teams.

Expected outcomes
-----------------

GitHub (and preferably also GitLab) are rendering Pod6 into HTML.


Required skills
---------------

- The student will have to do a lot of communicating with GitHub (and possibly
  GitLab) members, in order to come to a good solution that will be accepted by
  them.

- Knowledge on how Linguist works is a pro, but can be learned during the
  project just fine.
